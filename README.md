# Video-Captioner
* Please check out my video captioner project, here are some project descriptions: 
* o Implemented a video captioner from scratch to generate textual descriptions of a random video with CNN and RNN
* o Preprocessed image and text data into HDF5 format for high-performance processing
* o Leveraged Resnet and LSTM to encode features from video frames and decode them into sentences
* o Applied beam search during inference to improve output scores
