# Video-Captioner
Please check out my video captioner project, here are some project descriptions: 
* Implemented a video captioner from scratch to generate textual descriptions of a random video with CNN and RNN
* Preprocessed image and text data into HDF5 format for high-performance processing
* Leveraged Resnet and LSTM to encode features from video frames and decode them into sentences
* Applied beam search during inference to improve output scores
