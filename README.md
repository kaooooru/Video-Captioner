# Video-Captioner
#Please check out my video captioner project, here are some project descriptions:
#o Implemented a video captioner from scratch to generate textual descriptions of a random video with CNN and RNN
#o Preprocessed image and text data into HDF5 format for high-performance processing
#o Leveraged Resnet and LSTM to encode features from video frames and decode them into sentences
#o Applied beam search during inference to improve output scores
